#### Vulnerable Code: 

![Vulnerable Code](../media/code-53.png)


#### Solution: 

This code is vulnerable to Session Fixation Attacks. Session fixation attacks occur when an attacker can force a legitimate user to use a session ID that he knows.

To avoid fixation attacks, itâ€™s a good practice to generate a new session each time a user authenticates and delete/invalidate the existing session (the one possibly known by the attacker).
